I really like the simplicity and elegance of the [Svbtle](https://svbtle.com/) blogging platform.  But I missed having a searchable and dated archive of past posts that others could view.  So I made a Python script to scrape all the articles and format them into raw-markdown links.  Then I decided to make it into something others could easily use, and built it into a little web app.

**Suggested Use:**

Provide your blog's URL and hit the magic button. The resulting markdown can be posted as a stand-alone post, and you can link to it by adding that
post's URL as your 'website' in Svbtle's blog settings.
